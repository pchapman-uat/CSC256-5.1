# CSC256 Assignment 5.1: Manipulating Data with JavaScript

In this assignment, you will be creating a simple JavaScript page that will let the user input movie titles one by one, and then display the complete list in a second area. Create a button that allows the list to "display" in either a separate area of the webpage or in a second window. Create a "reset" button that clears the list.
